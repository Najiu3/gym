  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The School of Freedom is dedicated to fostering education and empowerment for Afghan girls, guiding them toward independence and job opportunities. The educational situation in Afghanistan has been deeply affected by years of conflict, political instability, and social constraints, particularly limiting girls' access to education.</p>
    <p>With a focus on innovation, we offer tailored programs and mentorship that create a nurturing environment where girls can thrive both academically and professionally. Our expertise spans educational development, leadership training, and advocacy for gender equality. We are committed to breaking societal barriers and challenging norms to ensure that Afghan girls gain equal access to opportunities, enabling them to become influential leaders in their communities and contribute to a brighter future for Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>In addition to supporting Afghan girls, The School of Freedom also provides education and tutoring for other students, ensuring that our programs reach as many learners as possible. Our commitment to education for all students underscores our belief that quality education is a powerful tool for transformation and growth.</p>
    <p>In the U.S., we support Afghan refugee youth through after-school tutoring, college prep, ESL mentorship, and are in the process of launching a dual-immersion charter school in Sacramento.</p>
